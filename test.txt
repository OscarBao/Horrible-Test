1: Assign an integer to the variable foo
======
foo = 1
======

2: Assign a float to a variable
======
foo = 1.1
======

3: Assign a float to the variable bar
======
bar = 1.1
======

4: Assign a dictionary to the variable baz
======
baz = {'foo':1.1, 'bar':2.2}
======

5: Assign a list to a variable
======
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
======

6: Assign a string to a variable
======
hi = "whee"
======


7: Print the methods for an int
======
x = 1
print dir(x)
======


8: Assign the list *[1,2,"three", "four"]* to the variable foobar and print the third item
======
foobar = [1, 2, "three", "four"]
print foobar[2]
======

X9: Use a for loop to print each item from the list used above
======
foobar = [1, 2, "three", "four"]
for i in foobar:
print i
======

X10: Use a for loop to iterate over the list *[1,2,3,1,45,6,1,7,8,1,8,5,1,4,7,8,1]* and print "foobar" for every # 1
======
d = [1,2,3,1,45,6,1,7,8,1,8,5,1,4,7,8,1]
for i in d:
	if i != 1:
		print i
	if i == 1:
		print "foobar"
======

11: Assign the dictionary *{"joel": "cool, "oscar": "awesome", "dog":2, 4:"cat"}* to the variable foo and print the 2nd item
======
x = {"joel":"cool", "oscar": "awesome", "dog":2, 4:"cat"}
print x["oscar"]
======

12: Use a while loop to count to 10
======
count = 0
while (count < 10):
	count = count + 1
	print count
======

BONUS: If a = 5 and b = 3 how would you switch the values using one line of code
EXAMPLE: if a = 3 and b = 2 the output would mean that a would = 2 and b would = 3
======
a, b = 5, 3
a, b = b, a
======
